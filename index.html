                    <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

                    <p>Saw it today and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

                    <p>When a 3-hour-long film doesn't SEEM like it lasts for 3 hours, that is an achievement in and of itself.  Few movies this lengthy are this entertaining.  The Godfather is one classic example.  (Actually that film is slightly less than 3 hours but still.) I can watch such a film over and over again and not get tired of it.  Or I can watch PARTS and never tire of THEM.  There are so many things to LIKE about THIS  film that the few criticisms I have are forgiveable.  I cannot talk about them here without spoiling anything for someone who hasn't yet seen ENDGAME or its predecessors in the MCU, so I won't elaborate.  What I will say is that of the 23 movies in the saga this is DEFINITELY among my top five favorites.  Marvel has managed to invest such personality into so many of its MCU characters that even those I don't particularly care for in the source comic book material come alive here, with few exceptions.  Again, a remarkable achievement given the scope of the storyline. That is really what makes this climactic installment stand so tall in my mind.  The epic storytelling, the characterization, the writing, and of course the action and special effects are all good to fantastic.  Most remarkable is how formidably the key antagonist Thanos presents.  Josh Brolin infuses such believabliity into the performance that you largely FORGET that what you are seeing on screen is mostly CGI.  (Another hallmark of a well-made film of this genre.) THIS Thanos comes across as far more grounded and believable than his comic book namesake.  And really, that is what it all boils down to.  At the core is good-versus-bad, yet raised to a level where the stakes are literally LIFE on a universal scale.  It took 22 films to build to this epic conclusion and the payoff is every bit as satisfying as it could and SHOULD be.  One could conceivably watch this film never having seen any of the prior ones and still enjoy it, though with a lot less emotional investment, never mind understanding of who all the key players are and why winning is so important to them.  That, I suppose, would be ENDGAME's biggest flaw; a movie goer must AT MINIMUM have watched AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR to have a basic understanding and any real emotional investment. </p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
